Here are a few suggestions to improve your website:

1. **Consistent Titles**:
   - Ensure that each project page has a unique and descriptive title instead of `PROJECT_NAME - Portfolio`.

2. **SEO Optimization**:
   - Add meta descriptions and keywords to each HTML page to improve search engine visibility.

        Replace the existing image references in your HTML files with the optimized images.
